            <h2>The Problem: Micromobility Risks & Failed Solutions</h2>
            <p>
                Improving transportation safety in Atlanta requires a specific focus on roads used by diverse modes of
                transit. Previous efforts to improve safety on major roads like Marietta Street have yielded poor
                results. A recent evaluation of street redesigns found that projects lacking physical separation failed
                to produce meaningful safety improvements for Light Individual Transport (LIT+) users (Wallace et al.,
                2021). In fact, accident rates for these vulnerable groups often increased post-project because the
                designs failed to address high vehicle speeds and complex intersection conflicts.
            </p>
            <p>
                The current state of Marietta Street creates a hostile environment where delivery trucks frequently
                block painted bike lanes, forcing riders into 45mph traffic. Unclear signage and the lack of vertical
                barriers create confusion, leading to dangerous merging behaviors and collisions.
            </p>

            <h2>The Evidence: Why Protected Lanes Work</h2>
            <p>
                In contrast to "paint-only" solutions, research overwhelmingly supports well-designed, physically
                separated lane systems. A microsimulation study on expanding the bike lane network in Downtown Atlanta
                found that dedicated lanes significantly improved safety by separating cyclists from vehicle traffic
                (Lee, 2022). Broader research across 12 U.S. cities confirms that cities with more protected bike
                infrastructure see significantly fewer fatalities and serious injuries for <em>all</em> road users,
                including motorists (Marshall & Ferenchak, 2019).
            </p>

                <h3 style="margin-top:0; color:white;">Efficiency & Economy</h3>
                <p style="margin-bottom:0;">
                    Contary to the belief that bike lanes hinder cars, Atlanta-based simulations show that a modal shift
                    of just 5% from cars to bikes decreases average stop delays for the entire network (Lee, 2022).
                    Furthermore, limiting micromobility has economic costs; a nighttime ban on e-scooters in Atlanta
                    increased travel times by up to 37% during large events and cost the city millions in lost
                    productivity (Asensio et al., 2022).
                </p>
            </div>

            <h2>A Model for Success: Georgia Tech's Cycle Track</h2>
            <p>
                Georgia Tech has already demonstrated the viability of these concepts with the Tech Parkway and Ferst
                Drive cycle track projects. Completed between 2019 and 2025, this infrastructure created a protected
                east-west corridor that physically separates riders from vehicles using curbs, buffers, and concrete
                barriers.
            </p>
            <p>
                This design enhances <strong>Safety</strong> by eliminating lane incursions, improves
                <strong>Connectivity</strong> by linking the Campus Rec Center to Tech Square, and supports
                <strong>Sustainability</strong> by encouraging low-carbon transit. The success of this "Gold-level"
                infrastructure serves as a blueprint for the adjacent city streets.
            </p>

            <h2>Proposed Solution for Marietta Street</h2>
            <p>
                We propose extending the safety standards of Tech Parkway to Marietta Street. To prevent dangerous
                interactions between cars and bikes, the street should be redesigned to include:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-6 text-gray-300 space-y-2">
                <li><strong>Raised Bike Lanes:</strong> Paving lanes flush with the sidewalk or installing bollards to
                    physically prevent vehicle entry.</li>
                <li><strong>Bike-Specific Signals:</strong> Dedicated traffic lights to manage conflicts between turning
                    vehicles and through-traffic riders.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Signage:</strong> Improved regulatory signage to prevent confusion regarding parking
                    zones and merging areas.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Budget & Implementation Options</h2>
            <p>To provide flexibility for the City, we present two implementation pathways:</p>

            <h3>Option A: Quick-Build Pilot (~$325,000)</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">Designed for rapid deployment to test effectiveness using flexible materials.</p>
            <table class="budget-table">

                    <th>Cost</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Pavement markings & striping (4,000 ft)</td>
                    <td>$120,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Flexible delineator posts (200 units)</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Design & Contingency</td>
                    <td>$110,000</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h3>Option B: Permanent Build (~$1.3 Million)</h3>
            <p class="text-sm">A durable, long-term transformation with concrete infrastructure.</p>
            <table class="budget-table">
                <tr>
                    <th>Item</th>

                <tr>
                    <td>Concrete curb-separated lanes (0.8 mi)</td>
                    <td>$800,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Signal heads & Signage</td>
                    <td>$57,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Design & Contingency</td>
                    <td>$430,000</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>
                The current design of streets like Marietta Street poses serious risks to the community. Painted bike
                lanes are no longer enough. We urge the Atlanta Department of Transportation to implement a connected
                network of protected bike lanes. Investing in this infrastructure will address urgent safety concerns,
                improve traffic efficiency, and demonstrate Atlanta’s commitment to a safer, smarter, and more
                sustainable transportation future.
